#PROJECT : SERVERLESS DATA PROCESSING

#TITLE : Halifax Foodie

DALSoft5410 is building a serverless Food Delivery system using multi-cloud deployment model, and backendas-a-service (BaaS). The Food Delivery System - “HalifaxFoodie”, should provide customization feature, and 
additional services for restaurant owners, and limited services to customers. The application should provide 
an online virtual assistance, which can quickly answer the queries of registered customers or guests.
In addition, the application should provide a chat functionality between a registered customer, and customer 
service representative if there are any delivery issues. Furthermore, the chat functionality can be extended to 
support customer escalation.
The application will provide data security, user {restaurant, and customers} management, customer feedback 
polarity analysis, food item delivery tracker, restaurant ratings, customer recommendation, and discount 
coupon etc. As an additional feature, each restaurant can upload their top recipe on the system for checking 
similarity score.
DALSoft5410 has selected serverless application to minimize the development and project running cost. The 
company has identified two cloud platforms - AWS, and GCP to build, test, and deploy their application. They 
have decided to follow the official documentations of AWS and GCP to build the different pieces. 
If they select server-oriented architecture, then they need to manage and configure the backend service, which 
they cannot do due to their resource limitations. Therefore, serverless is the only solution they found at this 
point. They have obtained two types of accounts from AWS, and one account from GCP, which they can use for 
building, testing, and deploying their application.
Since they are going to follow agile method, they can build, test, and change each components of the project
whenever there is a change in the requirements.
